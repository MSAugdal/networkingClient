# networkingClient
This repo contains a client for my networkingServer repo.

## What does this do?
Well, right now you can just send messages to the server, and get an ACK back.
The plan is to create a GUI for it, and to be able to have multiple clients send messages to eachother,
and possibly the ability to send images and encrypted messages.
